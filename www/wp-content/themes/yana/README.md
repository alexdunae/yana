# YANA WordPress Theme

## Adding content

## News

News posts are added to the `Posts` section and must be assigned to the `General News` category.  News posts can contain multiple images, galleries, videos and text.

For long posts, you may want to only show a snippet on the front page.  If so, insert WordPress's `Read More` marker where you'd like a break.  See http://en.support.wordpress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/ for details.

### Thank Yous

Thank Yous are added to the `Posts` section; they just need to be assigned to the `thanks` category.

Enter the text in the main body and, optionally, add a single full-width image.  The text (without the image) will be displayed on the homepage sidebar.  Images are available when people click through.  The image should always be full width, and should be at the end of the thank you note, or at least after the first paragraph if the note is long.

### Stories

Stories are regular pages, added as 'children' of the main stories page.  Each story needs an excerpt written for it.  Ideally each would also have a featured image.  If the featured image isn't possible, a default image will be displayed.

## Events

Events are added via the `Events` tab in the dashboard.  Events have an additional editing panel for event-specific data.  The event date field must be entered.  It is used for sorting events chronologically, and to determine when an event should no longer be shown.

Each event needs an excerpt.  All except for third-party events also need a featured image.

The main events page on the website shows all future events in chronological order, with higher priority events being displayed first.

## Sidebar Quotes

Sidebar quotes are drawn at random from the `sidebar-quotes.json` file (i.e. they need to be edited by the webmaster).
