# YANA WordPress Theme

## Events

Events are added via the `Events` tab in the dashboard.  Events have an additional editing panel for event-specific data.  The event date field must be entered.  It is used for sorting events chronologically, and to determine when an event should no longer be shown.

The main events page on the website shows all future events in chronological order, with higher priority events being displayed first.
